📊 *****Employee Turnover Prediction | Salifort Motors*****

**Project Overview**

Employee turnover presents a significant operational and financial challenge for Salifort Motors. High attrition leads to increased recruitment costs, productivity loss, and strain on team morale. This project leverages Python-based data analysis and machine learning to predict employee turnover and uncover the key drivers behind employee departures.

Using survey data collected by the HR department, this analysis explores how factors such as job role, department, workload, tenure, performance evaluation, salary level, and work-life balance indicators influence an employee’s likelihood of leaving the organization.

**Objectives**

- Analyze employee survey and HR data to identify patterns related to turnover

- Build and evaluate predictive models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

- Compare model performance using standard classification metrics

- Identify the most influential features contributing to employee attrition

- Translate analytical insights into clear, actionable business recommendations

**Approach**

- The project follows a structured data science workflow:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand workforce trends and potential risk factors

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering, including encoding categorical variables

- Model development and evaluation, focusing on interpretability and predictive performance

- Feature importance analysis to uncover the main drivers of turnover

- Executive-level insights aligned with HR and leadership decision-making

**Business Value**

The final model helps Salifort Motors proactively identify at-risk employees and understand why they may leave. These insights empower leadership to design targeted retention strategies, improve job satisfaction, and reduce long-term hiring and training costs.
